# Port Pulse

## Overview

Port Pulse is a macOS menu bar app built with SwiftUI that monitors the status of a specified network port. 

This project gave me a chance to practice Swift and XCode developing.

### Project Highlights

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Constantly checks the status of the specified port.
- **User Interaction:** Easily check and manage the port status through the macOS menu bar or the application window.
- **Customizable:** Adjust the target port and monitoring interval to suit your needs.

## Project Details

### Technologies Used

- SwiftUI
- Network Framework
- Swift programming language

## My Role

I conceptualized, designed, and implemented Port Pulse from the ground up. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Swift development, networking in macOS applications, and creating an intuitive user interface.

## Learning Points

- **SwiftUI:** Explored and applied SwiftUI for building the user interface.
- **Network Framework:** Learned how to use the Network framework for monitoring port status.
- **User Interaction:** Implemented features for user-friendly interaction in both the menu bar and application window.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Toggle not reflecting real state of boolean

Whenever the toggle is being clicked, the value of `monitor.showPortNumber` changes,
but whenever the window is being re-opened, the toggle always **shows the same value as it initially was, not the current value of the variable**.

        MenuBarExtra() {
            VStack {
                Form {
                    // other parts of window...
                    Section {
                        Toggle("", isOn: $monitor.showPortNumber)
                    //...
```

#### Solution: Still working on it... ðŸ˜¥

### Challenge: Icon not changing according to variable

In the project description, one would notice that I planned on showing the port status real-time on the Mac menu bar.
Naturally, my code would look something like this:

```swift {6-7}
MenuBarExtra() {
  // menu bar on click window
} label: {
    let colors: [String: NSColor] = ["UNKNOWN":.red, "IDLE":.gray, "RUNNING":.green]
    let configuration = NSImage.SymbolConfiguration(pointSize: 12, weight: .light)
        //! notice I called monitor.portStatusCode directly
        .applying(.init(paletteColors: [monitor.portStatusCode]))
    let image = NSImage(systemSymbolName: "circle.fill", accessibilityDescription: nil)
    let updateImage = image?.withSymbolConfiguration(configuration)
    Image(nsImage: updateImage!)
    if monitor.showPortNumber {
        Text("\(String(monitor.portNum))").font(.system(size: 3))
    }
}
```

but with this approach, **the icon color wouldn't change accordingly even if variable `monitor.portStatusCode` value has updated**

#### Solution: Object Property Re-assigning

TBH, I'm still having a hard time wrapping my head around why this solution would work, for now, I'm categorizing this as the
subtlety of Swift, perhaps someday I'll see why.

```swift {5-9}
MenuBarExtra() {
  // menu bar on click window
} label: {
    let colors: [String: NSColor] = ["UNKNOWN":.red, "IDLE":.gray, "RUNNING":.green]
    // by re-assigning object property to a variable in scope, the icon became dynamic
    let colorCode = monitor.portStatusCode
    let iconColor = colors[colorCode] ?? .red
    let configuration = NSImage.SymbolConfiguration(pointSize: 12, weight: .light)
        .applying(.init(paletteColors: [iconColor]))ription: nil)
    let updateImage = image?.withSymbolConfiguration(configuration)
    Image(nsImage: updateImage!)
    if monitor.showPortNumber {
        Text("\(String(monitor.portNum))").font(.system(size: 3))
    }
}
```

### Challenge: Handling Network Connections

Implementing real-time monitoring required a deep dive into handling network connections. Swift's Network framework provided a solid foundation, but handling various states required careful consideration.

#### Solution: Stateful Design

I implemented a stateful design that allowed seamless updates to the UI based on the connection state. This approach enhanced user experience and provided clear feedback on the port status.
