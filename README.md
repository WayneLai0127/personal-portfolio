## Why Nextra? (Project motivation)

There exists tons of template for personal portfolios that are way fancier than nextra,
but at the end of the day, I believe all we're looking for in a portfolio template is something **responsive**, **clean**, and **extendable**,
that's why I choose [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), the official documentation framework for thousands of projects for my personal portfolio.
